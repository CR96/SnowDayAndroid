SnowDayAndroid
==============

Android application that predicts the chance of a snow day for Grand Blanc Community Schools.

This program reads from the WJRT school closings webpage (http://abc12.com/closings)
and the National Weather Service (http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=42.92580&lon=-83.61870).

This project was started in July 2014.
The original Java version is being developed at CR96/SnowDay.
