SnowDayAndroid
==============

Android application that predicts the chance of a snow day for Grand Blanc Community Schools.

This program reads from the WJRT school closings webpage (http://ftpcontent2.worldnow.com/wjrt/school/closings.htm)
and the National Weather Service (http://forecast.weather.gov/afm/PointClick.php?lat=42.92580&lon=-83.61870).

This project was started in July 2014 and is currently a work in progress.
The original Java version is being developed at CR96/SnowDay.
